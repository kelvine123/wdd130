    <p>Kenya is a beautiful country in East Africa known for its breathtaking landscapes and rich wildlife. From the
        vast savannahs of the Maasai Mara to the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya, the country is home to lions,
        elephants, giraffes, and countless other species. Kenya’s national parks and reserves attract visitors from
        around the world who come to experience the famous Great Migration and the country’s vibrant culture and
        hospitality.</p>
